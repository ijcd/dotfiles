ADDITIONS:
1. fzf thingy that I can use to browse all these
2. some kind of key binding that will remind me of all of it
3. a banner at start up that talks about these things
4. an agent that watches what I am doing and makes suggestions for scripts/aliases I already have, a discoverability agent of sorts

TODO:
4. Clean up the bin directory to be more namespacey
5. Move gitconfig setup to nix
6. How will discoverability work for the git aliases vs scripts -- does that push it one way or the other?
