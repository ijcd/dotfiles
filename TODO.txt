ADDITIONS:
1. fzf thingy that I can use to browse all these
2. some kind of key binding that will remind me of all of it
3. a banner at start up that talks about these things
4. an agent that watches what I am doing and makes suggestions for scripts/aliases I already have, a discoverability agent of sorts
