ADDITIONS:
1. fzf thingy that I can use to browse all these
2. some kind of key binding that will remind me of all of it
3. a banner at start up that talks about these things

TODO:
1. Do we have anything as a top-level dot file that can now go into .config?
2. Move the brews to nix
3. Move the nix machine-specific to general (where it makes sense)
