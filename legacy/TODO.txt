1. It would be nice if we had something akin to emacs's use-package
2. Should these various helpers be functions or scripts?
3. How should the functions and scripts be organized given modules matter?

diff - look into using delta (or ressurrect mydiff-so-fancy)

direnv - keep init but place somewhere
dns - keep functions but move to my functions (dns-digall, dns-flush but improved)
dotnet - is this needed?
emacs - do we want this?
erlang - keep
highlighting - what is this? ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_MAXLENGTH
irc - is IRC still a thing?
kubernetes - just completions, do we need it here?
misc - what are these random network scripts?
networking - what are these helper scripts?
osx - what are all of these helpers?
postfix - little helper function
postgres - we have the pg_stop and pg_start scripts -- it would be nice to have a way to run all my functions/script helpers in a way where I can also search for them and ask about help etc (maybe using fzf on top of a module format of some sort?)
readline - do we keep this inputrc?
rust - just adds a path, maybe this can stay in a module somehow?
ssl - cert name helper
unison - maybe archive this?
vim - I think vierr is the only thing I use
