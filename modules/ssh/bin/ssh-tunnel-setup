#sudo ssh -NTCf -w 0:0 1.2.3.4
# -N Do not execute a remote command. This is useful for just forwarding ports (or in this case tunnels).
# -T Disable pseudo-tty allocation.
# -C Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data for forwarded X11 and TCP connections). Compress can speed up or potentially slow down your speed, so try with and without.
# -f Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.
