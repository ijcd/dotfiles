# lgrep - Line-buffered grep for live output
#
# Usage: lgrep [options] <pattern>
#
# Runs grep with --line-buffered to prevent output buffering.
# Essential when using grep in pipelines with tail -f or other
# streaming commands where buffering would delay output.
#
# Examples:
#   tail -f /var/log/syslog | lgrep error
#   some-command | lgrep -i warning
#   docker logs -f container | lgrep exception
#
# Without line buffering, grep may wait to accumulate a full buffer
# before outputting, causing delays in real-time log monitoring.

exec grep --line-buffered "$@"
