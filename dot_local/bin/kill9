# kill9 - Shortcut for kill -9 (SIGKILL)
#
# Usage: kill9 <pid>...
#
# Forcefully kills processes. Use when processes don't respond to
# normal termination signals.
#
# Examples:
#   kill9 1234              # Kill process 1234
#   kill9 1234 5678         # Kill multiple processes
#   pgrep -f myapp | xargs kill9   # Kill all matching processes
#
# Warning: SIGKILL cannot be caught or ignored. The process gets no
# chance to clean up. Use kill (SIGTERM) first when possible.

exec kill -9 "$@"
