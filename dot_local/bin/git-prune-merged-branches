# git-prune-merged-branches - Delete branches fully merged into a branch
#
# Usage: git prune-merged-branches [-fu] [-r <remote>] <merge-branch>
#
# Options:
#   -f            Really delete the branches. Without this, branches are
#                 shown but not actually deleted.
#   -r <remote>   Name of remote to operate on. Operate locally when not
#                 specified.
#   -u            Fetch <remote> before determining merged branch status.
#
# Examples:
#   List local branches already merged into master for inspection:
#     git prune-merged-branches master
#
#   Delete local branches already merged into master:
#     git prune-merged-branches -f master
#
#   List branches in origin remote already merged into origin/master:
#     git prune-merged-branches -u -r origin master
#
#   Delete branches in origin remote already merged into origin/master:
#     git prune-merged-branches -f -r origin master
