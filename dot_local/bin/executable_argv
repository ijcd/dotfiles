# argv - Debug script arguments
#
# Usage: argv [args...]
#
# Prints each argument on its own line with its position number.
# Useful for debugging shell scripts and understanding how arguments
# are being parsed/split.
#
# Examples:
#   argv foo bar baz        # Shows: 1: foo, 2: bar, 3: baz
#   argv "foo bar" baz      # Shows: 1: foo bar, 2: baz
#   argv $variable          # Debug word splitting
